- **Growing Disposable Income:** Chris and his husband are used to living on a budget, due to raising a family, however are now adjusting to being empty nesters. They allocate a few thousand dollars per year for charitable donations.

**Quote:**

**Alternate Quote:**

#### Goals
- **Learn:** Wants to learn more about the Rosarians. Understand our mission, history, community programs and events.

- **Get involved:** potentially as a volunteer or attendee at events.

- **Active Lifestyle:** Enjoys attending events and meeting new people.
- **Civic-Minded:** Interested in contributing to the community.
- **Tech-Savvy:** Comfortable using websites and social media for information.
- **Alternate: Non-emotional Decision Making:** Representing a potential funding source (trust, foundation, business, etc.) needs easy access to credible information to make a well-informed decision.

#### Frustrations, Challenges & Obstacles
- **Time:** Time is a main obstacle right now. The Rosarians are not currently a priority in his life, so any time he'd give to them would take away from something else that is a priority. He needs reasons why the Rosarians should be important to him.
- **Portland's image:** Does not like to see Portland struggle, and feels a bit helpless about how we can turn things around. Helplessness leads to lethargy. He recognizes this and works to avoid it.
- **Lack of Concise Information:** May find it difficult to locate clear, introductory information about the Royal Rosarians and their activities.

5. **Easy ways to connect deeper:** Show simple steps for people to become more engaged with the Rosarians, like the Auction, MCBR, and other activities.
6. **Make it easy to connect:** Nothing beats talking with a real person, and the website can provide ways for non-Rosarians to engage directly with Rosarians.

#### Motivation
Primarily motivated by curiosity and a desire to help Portland be a city to be proud of. He sees the Rosarians as a potential avenue for community involvement and engagement.

**Alternate:** Primarily motivated to best understand the RRF, its activities and outcomes, so he can make a recommendation on the request the RRF made for funding from his organization.
